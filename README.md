# JavascriptKMeans
A javascript implementation for the K-Means algorithm

After reading an article by Howard Yeend (Pure Mango) I decided I would try to write a version of the basic learn algorithm.

Having created a Javascript k-means function to process a single dimentional array I moved on to working out how to process a multi-dimentional array. The basic premise is the same, but you have to loop through the additional arrays and use a more advanced Euclidean n-space formula to calculate which cluster to allocate the point to.
